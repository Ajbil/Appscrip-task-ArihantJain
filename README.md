# Appscrip Frontend Developer Task – Arihant Jain

## 🧩 About the Project

The page replicates the structure and style of the provided Figma design.  
It includes:
- A responsive **Header** with logo, navigation, and icons.
- A **Product Listing Section** that fetches data dynamically.
- A **Filter Sidebar** with collapsible sections.
- A **Footer** matching the Figma layout, with newsletter, contact info, and payment icons.

The goal was to focus on clean, structured code and recreate the layout accurately while keeping it responsive and SEO-friendly.
